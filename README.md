# gzr.jenga
A modified truth or dare game with, Jenga bricks as the main center point. The Jenga bricks have numbers written on them. You pull a brick, set it on top, and do the dare of the number. This creates a simpler version that just rolls dares or allows you do play the Jenga game with more variety, 

DISCLAIMER**

This project is a Heavy WIP ---. Still learning JS and trying to fully understand how to fully realize this idea I have. Currently, just have some barebones HTML and CSS with a simple randomization system. I want to eventually have a full dare selection system.
