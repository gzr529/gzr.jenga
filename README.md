# gzr.jenga
Fun, truth or dare game with playing Jenga as the main center point. The Jenga bricks have numbers, you pull a brick, set it on top, and do the dare of the number. 

Heavy WIP - None of the JS works and the actual randomization process of 'dare' selection is NOT working. Still learning JS and trying to full understand how to fully realize this idea I have. Currently just have some barebones HTML and CSS with no real content.
