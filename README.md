# gzr.jenga
A modified truth or dare game with, Jenga bricks as the main center point. The Jenga bricks have numbers written on them. You pull a brick, set it on top, and do the dare of the number. 

DISCLIAMER**

This project is a Heavy WIP --- None of the JS works and the actual randomization process of 'dare' selection is NOT working. Still learning JS and trying to fully understand how to fully realize this idea I have. Currently just have some barebones HTML and CSS with no real content.
